	/********* HINTS (feel free to remove) *********
	Start your dialog here
	You basically have following options
	- 'defaults': use the defaults statement at the beginning to 
	  specify dialog that will be played every time the scene is triggered
	- 'first time' dialog lines: Use the keywords 'first time'
	  to introduce dialog lines which are only spoken once, when
	  the dialog is triggered the first time
	- 'other times' dialog lines: Add alternatives inside the first time
	  statement to introduce dialog lines which are shown instead
	- Conditional dialog lines: Use the statement 
	  'if (${Condition1} 'or' ${Condition2} ...)'
	  	${Body1}
	  'else' 'if'(${Condition3}) 
	  	${Body2}
	  'else'
	  	${Body3}
	  'end'
	  to introduce dialog lines which are only played when
	  the conditions are met.
	- You can create nested conditions by using the conditional statement somewhere in a Body 
	- Hubs: use the 'hub' keyword to create hubs of dialog where players have Choices
	- By default, hubs are "entered" when the dialog flow reaches a hub. Use the modifier 'hidden' 
	  to mark a hub as hidden for the general dialog flow and only accessible by an explicitly invoking it
	  using the 'enter hub' "${hubName}" statement at the end of a dialog block
	- Choices can only be used in hubs. You can create conditional choices ('choices if ...')
	- You can also enter scenes that way ('enter scene' "${otherSceneName}")
	- Choices can be marked as 'single' and/or 'random'
	- 'single' makes sure that this choice will be hidden once the player has chosen it
	- 'random' indicates that a choice might only be available by chance 
	  (the concrete implementation of that remains part of the dialog engine)
	- final dialog lines: Use the keywords 'parting' to
	  introduce dialog lines that are shown if all information has been
	  gathered by the player
